        \t\t\t\t\tMICA is one of the oldest social games that has stayed popular until today thanks to her simplicity. It is played by two players. Each of them has nine tokens which they place intermittently on the fields on the playing board. After placing tokens on the playing board, the players move one after the other their tokens vertically or horizontally only one field at a time. Playing diagonally does not count. At the moment where a player scores MICA, he or she takes any of the opponentâ€™s tokens which is not in MICA. The game is played until one of the players is completely unable to score MICA.
